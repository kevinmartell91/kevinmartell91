### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am interested in applying Large Language Models (LLMs), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in the medical industry, particularly for processing time-series motion capture (mocap) and wearable data, as well as data collection. I am pursuing an MSCS specializing in Machine Learning at UMass, with an expected graduation in May 2024.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am focused on achieving high-quality results using fine-tuned LlaMA-2 and ICD-11 data.

ðŸ‘¯ I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities for research and open-source projects within the medical industry.
